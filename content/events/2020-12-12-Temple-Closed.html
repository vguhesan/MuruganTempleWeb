		Dear Devotees: As the COVID case counts are rising, the temple management has decided to close the temple to the public until Jan 15, 2021. Mgt will meet regularly to decide on how to proceed further. All poojas will be performed by the priests and will be telecasted on FaceBook or Zoom. Please consider supporting the temple by sponsoring these online poojas. Your support is critical during this Pandemic. No house poojas will be performed. If you have any questions, please contact us at contactus@murugantemple.org
