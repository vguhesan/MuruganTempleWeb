Some of them such as the Amazon Smile requires no effort on your part but to simply designate "Murugan Temple" as the charity you support. Please go through them and provide us your support.<br><br>

			Murugan Temple of North America “MTNA” has been blessed with a congregation that has supported it unstintingly since the inception in 1999.  We thank the founders and senior members of MTNA congregation for their vision. This legacy must now be nurtured and preserved for future generations. With a segment of the congregation advancing in age and retiring, now is the appropriate time to create a Permanent Endowment Fund for the temple.<br>
			The permanent Endowment Fund of MTNA is established on Saturday, May 16th, 2018 to provide members and friends of the Temple with the opportunity to make charitable gifts to MTNA that will become a permanent endowment of financial support and a living memorial to the gift giver.<br>
