		<h5>The Process</h5> 
		We at Murugan Temple of North America will take all the necessary precautions to help ensure the safety of all visitors and employees while you make the visit to the temple.  To this extent, we will be following the Center of Disease Control (CDC) and Maryland local health department guidelines with regard to social-distancing practices in order to reduce the spread of COVID-19. As part of this effort, we have implemented a "Check-In" process that is available below <br>(<b>please print the needed forms at home, fill them out on the day of visit and bring them with you - one form per visitor.</b>)<br><br>
		Please check the visiting-hours shown above to make sure you are able to enter the temple during your visit. <br><b>NO EXCEPTIONS TO THE RULES.</b><br><u>You can only enter through the South-Entrance at this time.</u><br>(see picture below - click to see detailed picture)
