<h4>How do we accept donations?</h4>

<p>
	There are four methods through which Murugan Temple accepts donations:
	<br/>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Cash-Donations</b> - receipt is provided at the temple</li>
		<li><b>Bank Cheques</b> - receipt is provided at the temple or the check-transaction through your bank is the proof of payment</li>
		<li><b>Square Payments at Temple (using your credit-cards)</b> - individual receipts and statements<sup>*1</sup> will be available at <a href="https://squareup.com/" target="_blank">SquareUp.com</a></li> 
		<li><b>PayPal Payments via Temple Website</b> - individual receipts and statements<sup>*1</sup> will be available at <a href="https://paypal.com/" target="_blank">PayPal.com</a></li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p><sup>*1</sup> For both Square.com and PayPal.com - you will need to login into the respective sites using your personal login-id/email and password. Temple does not provide you with any login-id or password for access to those sites.</p>

<h4>Difference between a service and a donation?</h4>

<p>When you request a service such as an archana or abishekam, then a service is rendered in return for the payment. According to the IRS<sup>*2</sup>, anytime a payment is exchanged for a service in return then those payments are not tax-deductable. The same rule applies, when you purchase food items at the temple kitchen.<p>

<p>
	<sup>*2</sup> For more information on which items can be deducted (from the IRS - 529 Charitabe Contributions), please visit:

		<li><a href="https://www.irs.gov/help/ita/can-i-deduct-my-charitable-contributions" target="_blank">IRS Chartitable Contributions Website</a></li> 
	</ul>
</p>

<h4>How do I determine my deductions?</h4>

<p>Please use the recipts for any cash donations you've made or the personal cheques and/or statements from both Square and PayPal to compute the amount that can be catogorized as donations (and not services rendered).</p>

<p>For further information, please contact our temple. Thank you.</p>
