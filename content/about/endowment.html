<p><b>What is an Endowment?</b></p>
<p><b>An <em>endowment</em></b> is any asset donated to and for the perpetual (everlasting) benefit of a non-profit organization. The donation is usually made with the requirement that the principal remain intact and money earned from investing the principal be used for a specific purpose. Endowment creates an ongoing source of income and provides Growth, Financial Safety and Stability to the organization.</p>
<p><b><u>Purpose of Murugan Temple of North America (MTNA) Endowment Fund:</u></b></p>
<p>Murugan Temple of North America “MTNA” has been blessed with a congregation that has supported it unstintingly since the inception in 1999.&nbsp; We thank the founders and senior members of MTNA congregation for their vision. This legacy must now be nurtured and preserved for future generations.</p>
<p>In order for MTNA to sustain its growth and maintenance, it is essential to have a regular flow of funds apart from the operating budget and some other existing financial sources and expectations. In 2013, the Board of Trustees (BOT) had initiated a “MTNA Long Term Self Sufficiency” initiative. In 2015, “MTNA Endowment Fund (MEF) Steering Committee” was formed, which developed a strategy and an action plan to establish the MTNA Endowment fund. With a segment of the congregation advancing in age and retiring, now is the appropriate time to create a Permanent Endowment Fund for the temple.</p>
<p>The Board of Trustees decided to form the Permanent Endowment Fund Committee as part of the existing structure of the temple administration. The MTNA Endowment Fund is duly organized through the authority of the Board of Trustees of MTNA and in accordance with the By Laws of MTNA, as revised.</p>
<p>The permanent Endowment Fund of MTNA is established on Saturday, May 16<sup>th</sup>, 2018 to provide members and friends of the Temple with the opportunity to make charitable gifts to MTNA that will become a permanent endowment of financial support and a living memorial to the gift giver. The Fund is intended for Temple purposes which are not funded through the annual operating<b> </b>budget; however, gifts intended to supplement programs and projects will be allocated as appropriate.<b> </b>Endowment Funds may be designated for special programs by the donors.&nbsp;</p>
